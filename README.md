# HR-Data-Analytics-Tableau
HR analytics measures the successes and failures of how well the company is performing when it comes to its employees.

HR analytics came to be in the hopes that businesses could improve internal processes that relate to functions such as payroll, benefits, hiring, employee onboarding, employee performance and overall employee morale.
### Project Overview:
I created two interactive dashboards using Tableau to provide valuable insights into employee Performance and Attritions within our company.

### ðŸ“ˆ Overview Dashboard: Unveiling Key Employee Insights:
By leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, I have transformed raw HR data into intuitive visualizations that provide a holistic view of our workforce. This dashboard enables stakeholders and decision-makers to access real-time insights on critical HR metrics such as headcount, diversity, departments, performance ratings, and overall engagement levels. Through interactive charts, graphs, and filters, users can dive deep into the data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize talent management strategies.

### ðŸ”„ Attrition Dashboard: Unraveling Insights into Employee Departures:
The second dashboard focuses specifically on attrition, a vital aspect of HR management. With Tableau's advanced analytics features, I have developed an interactive dashboard that empowers HR professionals to delve into the underlying factors contributing to employee attrition, this dashboard reveals valuable insights into patterns, potential causes, and areas of improvement. By identifying attrition hotspots, understanding the reasons behind departures, and exploring correlations with employee satisfaction and performance, HR can take proactive measures to enhance employee retention and foster a positive work environment.pany.
